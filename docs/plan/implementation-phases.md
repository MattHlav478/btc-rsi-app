# Implementation Phases

1. **Scaffolding** (current): Establish backend, frontend, and infrastructure skeletons with placeholder implementations.
2. **Data Integration**: Connect to CoinGecko, persist candle data, and compute RSI metrics on schedule.
3. **Visualization**: Build interactive charts and alert configuration UI in the frontend.
4. **Automation**: Add CI pipelines, automated testing, and container orchestration manifests.
